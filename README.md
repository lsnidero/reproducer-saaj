# Small reproducer for saaj-error

This little project should use **java 11** and uses the soap WS exposed from  https://github.com/lokeshgupta1981/Spring-Boot3-Demos.git in the **soap-ws-example** folder. 

Just point to http://localhost:9080/api/test in order to test the invocation to the soap server.
